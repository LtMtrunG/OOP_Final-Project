Reflection:
	- Admin account:
		Username: admin
		Password: oop
	- We were able to make the account's promotion process automatically done by the system. 
	However, we did not have time to record and edit a new video so the "Promote" button still 
	appeared in the demostation video, but it had been removed in real application.
	- Some features were not completed such as "Remember me" and "Forget Password?" due to the 
	limit of tools and time.
	- Throughout the project, all members in the team were not familiar with GitHub so used teams
	as the main mean of sharing and uploading code. We only uploaded the project to GitGub when 
	it entered the final stage.
