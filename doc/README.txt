Reflection:
	- Admin account:
		Username: admin
		Password: oop
	- We were able to make the account's promotion process automatically done by the system. 
	However, we did not have time to record and edit a new video so the "Promote" button still 
	appeared in the demonstration video, but it had been removed in real application.
	- Throughout the project, all members in the team did not familiar with GitHub so used teams
	as the main mean of sharing and uploading code. We only uploaded the project to GitHub when
	it entered the final stage.
